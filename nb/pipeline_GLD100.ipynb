However, this is likely to happen more often for degraded craters (such as the rayed crater dataset, that contains both young and old craters).

    "There are a few problems by using ellipse... approximating the rim of a crater with an ellipse is totally ok, but it will always result in \"shooting\" over or under the actual position of the rim of crater. The majority of morphometric parameters (e.g., middle, upper, rim flank slope) are a bit sensitive to the exact location of the rim. I think I will try to create a function that retrieve the breaks in slope within 10% of the ellipse, and then use those few locations to extract cross sections and calculate parameters. This means that not all of the craters will have a constant number of cross-sections (512) as for ellipses. I will compare the results of those different values."
